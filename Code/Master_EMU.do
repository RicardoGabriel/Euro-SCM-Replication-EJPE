* Austria: 1
* Belgium: 3
* Finland: 7
* France: 8
* Germany: 9
* Greece: 10 - take into account that Greece has a different treatment date 
* Ireland: 12 - careful when analysing normalized gdp - remove the match in 1997Q3-1998Q4 because Ireland is impossible to match, it is the country with highest gdp growth in the pre-treatment sample!
* Italy: 14
* Luxembourg : 16 - leave it out of the analysis when using (non-normalized) gni or real gdp per capita - because its high level can't be matched.
* Netherlands : 18
* Portugal : 21
* Spain : 22
