## To-do list
	1. Create Table with RMSPEs from Figure 4 (pre-treatment) - check Puzello paper.

	2. Produce GDP decomposition for in-time placebo Maastricht Treaty - might help us understand differences between 93-99 period from the 99-07 effects and give more intuition to a) anticipation effects and b) drivers of heterogeneous effects.

	3. Run SCM with new controls (average inflation, unemployment rate, what else?)

	4. Run SCM for real GDP per capita (for ref report); inflation (maybe using same weights as before); long term rates; trade (ref 2); GNI (ref 2.5).

	5. Run SCM for 99-2012 sample and 99-2020 sample? - For referee report only.

	6. Perform in-time fake placebo test after Euro adoption (2002) - For ref report only.

	7. Add paragraph on lit review with political economy papers - asked by editor, include other EJPE papers.
